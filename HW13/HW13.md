### Read from the MPU6050

[IMU video from 2022, same IMU but different microcontroller](https://youtu.be/b-GtperFmIY)

An IMU, or inertial measurement unit, is a sensor that is used to calculate position, velocity, or acceleration. Modern IMUs are [MEMS devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microelectromechanical_systems), with built in analog to digital converters, and their own dedicated microcontroller to control and process the data ([example from Digikey](https://www.digikey.com/en/articles/techzone/2018/jan/apply-sensor-fusion-to-accelerometers-and-gyroscopes)).  

Common IMUs combine accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and altimeters. Often they come packaged together in a single chip (although altimeters are still new and less common). The sensors typically communicate over I2C or SPI.  

We will use the [MPU6050](https://invensense.tdk.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MPU-6000-Datasheet1.pdf) accelerometer and gyroscope chip made by Invensense, soldered onto a breakout board by [Stmedu](https://www.amazon.com/MPU-6050-Accelerometer-Three-Axis-Arduino-Quadcopter/dp/B07PY38BCB) or similar. This IMU is an old model, and suspiciously inexpensive, maybe a knockoff or out of spec?

There's definitely something off here, the MPU-6050M (note the extra M) might be a batch of chips for a specific product and not made generally available but has now found its way onto amazon. Be on the lookout for a chip that uses a slightly different I2C address.  

This chip measures acceleration (accelerometer) and angular velocity (gyroscopic) data about the X, Y, and Z axes with 16 bit resolution, with a variety of sensitivities. It contains a temperature sensor so that it can self correct for temperature effects, and we can also access the temperature data as a 16 bit number.  

The MPU6050 can communicate over I2C (and a related chip, the MPU6000, over SPI). We will use I2C to reduce the number of pins used from the Pico.  

Stemedu has made it easy to hook up the chip. Connect 3.3V to VCC, GND to GND, I2C0 SDA to SDA, and I2C0 SCL to SCL. The 10k pull up resistors are built onto the breakout board, so you don't have to add them. The MPU6050 PCB sets the 7 bit address of the chip to 0b1101000 (0x68).  

The IMU has a register called WHO_AM_I, which contains the constant value hex 68. After initializing I2C, read from WHO_AM_I and check that you get the right value back (according to the datasheet it should return 0x68 but different part numbers could return 0x98 instead), this will check that your I2C bus is working and the chip is plugged in and ready to communicate. If you don't get the right value back, go into an infinite loop and turn on your LEDs so that you know you need a power reset.   

Write a function to initialize the MPU6050. This chip has many cool features, but we just want the bare bones ability to read the three acceleration, three angular velocity, and temperature data at any time. Out of the dozen registers, only three need to be changed. The registers are listed on a [different datasheet](https://invensense.tdk.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MPU-6000-Register-Map1.pdf).    

To turn on the chip, write 0x00 to the PWR_MGMT_1 register to turn the chip on.  

To enable the accelerometer, write to the ACCEL_CONFIG register. Set the sensitivity to plus minus 2g.  

To enable the gyroscope, write to the GYRO_CONFIG register. Set the sensitivity to plus minus 2000 dps.    

You can find these registers and their bits in the datasheet. Typically you want to save all the registers as #defines:

```c
// config registers
#define CONFIG 0x1A
#define GYRO_CONFIG 0x1B
#define ACCEL_CONFIG 0x1C
#define PWR_MGMT_1 0x6B
#define PWR_MGMT_2 0x6C
// sensor data registers:
#define ACCEL_XOUT_H 0x3B
#define ACCEL_XOUT_L 0x3C
#define ACCEL_YOUT_H 0x3D
#define ACCEL_YOUT_L 0x3E
#define ACCEL_ZOUT_H 0x3F
#define ACCEL_ZOUT_L 0x40
#define TEMP_OUT_H   0x41
#define TEMP_OUT_L   0x42
#define GYRO_XOUT_H  0x43
#define GYRO_XOUT_L  0x44
#define GYRO_YOUT_H  0x45
#define GYRO_YOUT_L  0x46
#define GYRO_ZOUT_H  0x47
#define GYRO_ZOUT_L  0x48
#define WHO_AM_I     0x75
```

Write a function to read out all the data. An inefficient way would be to read out one byte at a time. A better way is to do a burst read, getting all the data in a row. Luckily all the data is in a row inside the chip! Do a sequential read of 14 bytes and you'll get all the data.  

The sequential bytes need to be recombined into 16 bit signed integers. Write a function that takes the first byte of each measurement, shifts it left by 8 bits, and ORs the second byte.  If you multiply the acceleration by 0.000061 it will have the units of g. If you multiply the gyroscope by 0.007630 it will have the units of degrees per second. If you divide the temperature by 340.00 and add 36.53 it will have the units of degrees C.  

With a 2g sensitivity and Z facing up, the Z acceleration value should be about -16383, and the X and Y acceleration values should be about 0. When not moving, the X Y and Z gyro values should be about 0. The temperature value should increase if you touch the chip to warm it up. All of the values should fluctuate a little, and have some slight bias.     

Read the data out at 100Hz and print to your computer. Double check that the X and Y acceleration values make sense.  

### Assignment
Read from the IMU, and use the X and Y acceleration vectors to draw a lines out from the center of the OLED display proportional to the direction and magnitudes. Update the screen often enough so that the lines always point down as quickly as you can rotate the board.  

Upload your code to a folder called HW13 in your repo, and record a short video demonstrating your OLED display around as you tilt your breadboard and upload to Canvas.  


### Bonus Assignment (not required)
Combine the MPU6050 and USB Mouse code. Replace delta X and delta Y with values from the X and Y acceleration. Map the acceleration values so that a reasonable tilt makes a controllable mouse cursor (probably mapping 0g to 0, some g to 1, and some larger g to 2, really throwing away most of the resolution of the accelerometer). You may want to implement some deadband. Upload your code to a sub folder in HW13 in your repo, and record a short screen capture demonstrating your mouse moving around as you tilt your breadboard and upload to Canvas.
