This hearty stew is a Brazilian classic, known for its rich, smoky flavor and comforting, slow-cooked texture. Feijoada is traditionally made with black beans and a variety of meats. It's perfect for a weekend meal and tastes even better the next day.

### Ingredients
- 1 lb dried black beans (or 2 cans, drained and rinsed)
- 1/2 lb pork shoulder, cut into chunks
- 1/2 lb chorizo or smoked sausage, sliced
- 1/2 lb bacon or pork belly, chopped
- 1 onion, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 bay leaves
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- Water or chicken broth to cover
- (Optional) orange slices and chopped parsley for garnish

### Instructions
1. **(If using dried beans)** Soak beans overnight or use the quick soak method (boil for 2 minutes, then let sit 1 hour).
2. In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium heat.
3. Add bacon and cook until it begins to crisp. Then add sausage and pork shoulder, browning all sides.
4. Add chopped onion and garlic. Cook until onion is translucent.
5. Add soaked or canned beans, bay leaves, salt, and pepper. Cover with water or broth.
6. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer covered for 2–3 hours, or until the beans and meats are tender. Stir occasionally and add more liquid as needed.
7. Adjust seasoning. Remove bay leaves before serving.
8. Serve hot with white rice, sautéed collard greens, and orange slices on the side.

Bom apetite!
